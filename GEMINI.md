# _SUDOTEER: The Architect Agent Agency

This file serves as the primary project context and instruction set for Gemini (Antigravity).

## Current Mandate

As the "Main Responsible Party," my goal is to architect and implement **_SUDOTEER**—a premium forensic/financial intelligence desktop application.

## Core Directives

1. **Architectural Rigor**: Adhere to the layered architecture patterns (Base -> Platform -> Workbench) defined in the `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
2. **Coding Standards**: Use 100% Tabs for indentation, PascalCase for types, and JSDoc for all public interfaces.
3. **Agency Integration**: Coordinate the 5-agent team (Architect, Coder, Tester, Documenter, Validator) using the `LLM-Local-Agent` core (Decomposition, Orchestration, Memory).
4. **Premium UX**: Ensure the Electron frontend (based on the VS Code foundation) reflects a "Wow" aesthetic with Livekit voice interaction.
5. **Memory Consistency**: Use the 3-layer hybrid router with a Supabase persistent backend.
6. **Architecture Reference**: Consult [Sandbox Agency 1.md](Sandbox%20Agency%201.md) for the authoritative blueprint on the 3-Tier Agency, Industrial PLC Bridge, and Workstation Isolation.
