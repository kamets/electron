- ✅ **PH LEVEL**: 6.8 (water pH)

### **Right Panel**:
- ✅ **HUMIDITY**: 62% (air moisture)
- ✅ **PLANT HEALTH**: 95% (overall plant condition)

### **Center**:
- ✅ **Master Grower - Active** (clear role)
- ✅ **Continuous monitoring: [live uptime]** (shows you're watching)

## ❌ **REMOVED** (Scary/Useless):
- ❌ "CPU LOAD" (who cares?)
- ❌ "AGENT STYABILITY" (typo + meaningless)
- ❌ "Forensic audit protocols" (wrong context)

## 🎯 **NOW IT MAKES SENSE FOR GROWERS:**

**Before** (scary tech jargon):
```
CPU LOAD: 12%  ← What do I do about this?!
AGENT STYABILITY: 98.4%  ← Huh?!
```

**After** (useful info):
```
HUMIDITY: 62%  ← Good, plants like this
PLANT HEALTH: 95%  ← Excellent!
```
