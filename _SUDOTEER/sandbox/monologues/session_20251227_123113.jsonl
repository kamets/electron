The climate agent is specifically designed to handle temperature-related tasks, including reading and monitoring environmental conditions such as temperature in a greenhouse setting. Given that the system's focus is on greenhouse seed production and development, the climate agent is well-suited for this task due to its direct capability in managing temperature data.", "metadata": {}}
